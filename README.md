## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Get Proxies

The script requires a list of proxies to function effectively. You should have a file named `proxy.txt` (or similar) in the project directory with proxies in the `IP:PORT` format, one per line. The script's help text suggests using a scraper, which you might need to run first if available.

```bash
# Example command if you have a scraper.py
python3 scrape.py
